# VoiceBot

VoiceBot is an interactive conversational AI application designed to enhance user communication through both text and voice inputs. This project integrates advanced text and speech technologies to offer a seamless and engaging experience. Users can interact with the bot either by typing their messages or speaking directly into their devices.

## Key Features

- **Text Communication:** Users can type messages to the bot and receive immediate, contextually relevant responses.
- **Voice Interaction:** By utilizing Speech-to-Text (STT) technology, users can speak to the bot, which will transcribe their spoken words into text for processing.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** The bot can convert its text responses into speech, allowing users to hear the botâ€™s replies, enhancing the interactivity of the conversation.
- **Dynamic Theme Toggle:** Users have the option to switch between light and dark themes for a personalized visual experience.

## Technologies

- **Backend:** Developed using Flask (Python), which manages API requests and interactions.
- **STT:** Employs the `speech_recognition` library to transcribe audio input into text.
- **TTS:** Utilizes `pyttsx3` for converting text responses into spoken audio.
- **Frontend:** Crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an intuitive user interface.
